# Booking Management — Web Demo

This is a small static web demo for a movie booking interface. It is intended to be added to your portfolio or repo as a simple interactive front-end.
Features:
- Choose cinema, time and number of seats
- Client-side booking storage using `localStorage`
- View and cancel bookings
- Download a simple ticket as `ticket.txt`

## Run locally
1. Open `index.html` in a browser (no server required).  
2. Or serve with a static server (recommended):
   - Python 3: `python -m http.server 8000` then open `http://localhost:8000`

## Files
- `index.html` — main page
- `styles.css` — stylesheet
- `app.js` — client-side behaviour
- `README.md` — this file

Notes: This demo uses placeholder poster/thumbs instead of local image files. You can replace `.poster` and `.thumb` areas with images by editing `index.html`.
